The home.ejs page is not DRY
Do not disturb the database.
Refactor the page so that the code does not repeat but the page and cards still render correctly
You may have to do some work in your route for the file


Developer Log steps:

Planned out steps:

0. !!backup home.ejs

1. create an array module exports file with pictures link, name of product and description 
in dir routes/data/publicData.js from views/main/home.ejs page manually inputting correct data and
module.exports into a variable called publicProductsData

2. in routes/index.js import a variable publicProductsData from step 1 and in router.get('/) on line 30
after if(req.user) import aforementioned variable into res.render('main/home.ejs)

3. in views/main/home.ejs remove all but one card and wrap it with ejsfor loop 9 times for displaying
the data from step 1.
